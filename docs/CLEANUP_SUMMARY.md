- `android/` - Old Capacitor Android project (replaced by `apps/mobile/android/`)
- `ios/` - Old Capacitor iOS project (replaced by Expo)
- `capacitor.config.ts` - Old Capacitor configuration (replaced by Expo `app.config.ts`)

## Updated Dependencies

### ✅ Removed Capacitor Packages

- `@capacitor/android`
- `@capacitor/app`
- `@capacitor/core`
- `@capacitor/haptics`
- `@capacitor/ios`
- `@capacitor/keyboard`
- `@capacitor/local-notifications`

- `rimraf`: `^5.0.0` (replaces multiple old versions)
- `inflight`: Replaced with `once@^1.4.0`
- Babel plugins: Updated to transform plugins
- ESLint packages: Updated to new `@eslint/*` namespace

## Updated Scripts

### ✅ Replaced Capacitor Scripts

- `mobile:sync` → Now points to Expo
- `mobile:build` → Now uses `eas build`
- `mobile:ios` → Now uses `eas build --platform ios`
- `mobile:android` → Now uses `eas build --platform android`
- `capacitor:*` scripts → Now show helpful messages pointing to Expo

```

## Migration Notes

- **Mobile builds**: Use `cd apps/mobile && eas build` instead of Capacitor
- **Development**: Use `cd apps/mobile && pnpm start` for Expo Go
- **Native projects**: Generated by `expo prebuild` in `apps/mobile/android/` and `apps/mobile/ios/`

## Remaining Deprecated Warnings

Some deprecated dependencies may still appear as warnings because they're transitive dependencies. These are safe to ignore:

- They're used by other packages internally
- The overrides will force newer versions when possible
- They don't affect functionality

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Old Capacitor directories removed
2. ✅ Capacitor dependencies removed
3. ✅ Scripts updated to use Expo
4. ⚠️ Some deprecated transitive dependencies may still show warnings (safe to ignore)
